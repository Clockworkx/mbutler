can someone tell me whether this is an array of objects? [
  br: {
    wins: 266,
    kills: 3916,
  },
  br_dmz: {
    wins: 0,
    kills: 0,
 
  },
  br_all: {
    wins: 266,
    kills: 3916,
    
  }
]

is that yamel or something? It's not conventional json which makes it look like a config file?
The trailing commas is an interesting one
SaintMorningheute um 06:54 Uhr
it's output from some api
humblecoderheute um 06:54 Uhr
@SaintMorning looks like you're trying to do an "associative array" . . . . they don't really exist in JS
SaintMorningheute um 06:54 Uhr
maybe I should do some .json() on it?
Martyheute um 06:54 Uhr
then yes it looks like a collection of records tailored to a key being an individual
humblecoderheute um 06:54 Uhr
change your outside [] to {}
solarisheute um 06:54 Uhr
can someone send me guild link where it is explained how to create new channel with the bot
SaintMorningheute um 06:55 Uhr
maybe .json() will do the trick?
humblecoderheute um 06:55 Uhr
Nope
Change your braces
{}
SaintMorningheute um 06:55 Uhr
how could I change the braces :open_mouth:
I don't generate the output
humblecoderheute um 06:55 Uhr
oh, where's it coming from?
SaintMorningheute um 06:55 Uhr
from call of duty api :open_mouth:
I tried accessing it like variable[0].br.wins but it didnt work. for some reason variable.br.wins works..
although this returns true console.log(Array.isArray(playerData))
I am confused af
humblecoderheute um 06:57 Uhr
you try typeof just to see?
Stitchheute um 06:57 Uhr
whats ur question again?
coneillheute um 06:57 Uhr
typeof [] is 'object' tho
so that may not be helpful
humblecoderheute um 06:57 Uhr
@Stitch got "bad data" from API
SaintMorningheute um 06:57 Uhr
I asked this : can someone tell me whether this is an array of objects?
 [
  br: {
    wins: 266,
    kills: 3916,
  },
  br_dmz: {
    wins: 0,
    kills: 0,
 
  },
  br_all: {
    wins: 266,
    kills: 3916,
    
  }
]
coneillheute um 06:57 Uhr
where are the docs for the api?
Stitchheute um 06:58 Uhr
what the heck?

Stitchheute um 06:58 Uhr
that doesn make sense lol
SaintMorningheute um 06:58 Uhr
It is not direct use of the api, but I thought using that module might work and save myself time :frowning:
or maybe this is unconventional? 
let playerData;
        try {
            playerData = await codAPI.MWwz(name, codAPI.platforms[platform])
        }
        catch (err) {
            message.channel.send('User not found or wrong platform selected')
        }
maybe I am the cause of the bad output :/

this is dumb

Stitchheute um 07:00 Uhr
no.. its wrong
it syntactically doesnt even make sense
coneillheute um 07:00 Uhr
its "correct" but its obviously not how arrays shoudl be used
theyre takcing props onto the array object
Stitchheute um 07:00 Uhr
i mean
[
  br: {
    wins: 266,
    kills: 3916,
  },
  br_dmz: {
    wins: 0,
    kills: 0,
 
  },
  br_all: {
    wins: 266,
    kills: 3916,

  }
]
coneillheute um 07:00 Uhr
yea like I said dumb.
SaintMorningheute um 07:01 Uhr
so does it try to be like a named array?
which does not exist in js?
coneillheute um 07:01 Uhr
it should just be an object
SaintMorningheute um 07:01 Uhr
yea right?
humblecoderheute um 07:01 Uhr
. . .if the contents were parseable
coneillheute um 07:01 Uhr
make a pr to them or raise an issue
humblecoderheute um 07:01 Uhr
But they're not
[] is an object but [random:stuf=>run;cut:butter] is not  :lol:
Stitchheute um 07:02 Uhr
either turn the []  into {}  . or put {} inside []
humblecoderheute um 07:02 Uhr
^  . . . pretty sure there's an echo.  :wink:
SaintMorningheute um 07:03 Uhr
:smile: So, on my part I cannot fix it, right?
coneillheute um 07:03 Uhr
you want a really shitty way to fix it?
SaintMorningheute um 07:03 Uhr
except use it in the ugly way
yea, sure
Stitchheute um 07:03 Uhr
u can..  grab it as a string,   replace it... then u can parse it out
coneillheute um 07:03 Uhr
JSON.stringify(result) and then replace the first and last characters with { and } and then parse it back to an opbject
dammit lol
Stitchheute um 07:03 Uhr
yes
coneillheute um 07:03 Uhr
you beat me
Stitchheute um 07:04 Uhr
well. u went into detail. i didnt lol
whomever made that api
-_-"
sad
SaintMorningheute um 07:04 Uhr
it kind of reflects the quality of the game :smile: (modern warfare)
coneillheute um 07:04 Uhr
either misunderstanding of arrays or thought they were doing something clever
weebheute um 07:05 Uhr
is to bloated to have ngrx
humblecoderheute um 07:05 Uhr
@SaintMorning out of curiosity, what are actually building?
weebheute um 07:05 Uhr
in angular
SaintMorningheute um 07:06 Uhr
first of all, thank you guys a lot for the help and entertaiment

I am building a very simple bot command to display modern warfare stats for my discord bot that no-one uses anyway (doing that j4f) :smile:
humblecoderheute um 07:06 Uhr
:rofl: :thumbsup:
Stitchheute um 07:06 Uhr
use a diff api :smile:
SaintMorningheute um 07:07 Uhr
I don't think there is a different api for the call of duty servers :smile:
Stitchheute um 07:07 Uhr
prob not.  i was hoping there would be for ur sake
SaintMorningheute um 07:07 Uhr
haha :smile:
Stitchheute um 07:07 Uhr
i wold just hate to have made an app that feels kind of finicky because ur gunna hvae to alter the data like that
coneillheute um 07:07 Uhr
This persons API wrapper looks wierd tho.
theres like cookie data embedded in the library
SaintMorningheute um 07:08 Uhr
yea, right? I did not understand that either, not sure if that was a requirement or so.. but I did not question it any further :smile:
